Use the 2PBO folder .bat file to instantly create mission files based on a packed .VR pbo file.

Instructions:

1. Work on the .VR mission file unpbo'd.
2. When you've finished editing the mission and have saved it, use Eliteness or other PBO tools to pack the .VR file.
3. Dump the pbo'd .VR file into the 2PBO folder and overwrite then  run the .bat file.
4. Watch the magic in front of your eyes.

If you're using this outside of Sigma Security Group, you will need to change filenames.txt to correspond to the correct mission file names your group uses.
